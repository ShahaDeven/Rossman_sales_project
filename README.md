# ðŸ§  Time Series Sales Forecasting with LSTM

This project implements a deep learning-based time series forecasting model to predict retail store sales using historical data. It leverages stacked LSTM neural networks and autoregressive forecasting to accurately estimate sales for the next 1, 7, and 30 days.

## ðŸ“Š Overview

- Dataset: Rossmann Store Sales (from Kaggle)
- Model: Bidirectional + stacked LSTM with dropout and regularization
- Objective: Forecast daily sales for each store using temporal and contextual features
- Output: Daily sales predictions for future time horizons (1, 7, 30 days)
- Evaluation Metrics: MAE, RMSE, RÂ² Score
- Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna

## ðŸ”§ Features & Techniques

âœ” Cleaned and preprocessed sales data, removed outliers  
âœ” Engineered date-based features (DayOfWeek, IsWeekend, WeekOfYear, etc.)  
âœ” Scaled inputs and target using MinMaxScaler  
âœ” Generated input sequences for LSTM with a window of 30 days  
âœ” Implemented:
  - Next-day sales forecast  
  - 7-day rolling forecast  
  - 30-day rolling forecast  
âœ” Tuned LSTM architecture using Optuna  
âœ” Visualized predictions using both smoothed and downsampled plots
